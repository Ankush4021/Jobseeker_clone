# Jobseeker_clone
I created a clone of the JobSeeker website that replicates the core layout and user interface of a modern job portal. The project includes features like a job search bar, featured job listings, company profiles, login/register pages, and clean navigation. It showcases front-end development skills using HTML, CSS, and optionally JavaScript for interactive elements.
